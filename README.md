# Pong_game_in_Java

This is the classic pong game written in Java, as well as my first attempt to create a small Java game.

You can play the game using the 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys to move the paddle (platform).

The game itself is not optimized and uses simple techniques for the graphics to be drawn.

It also features basic opponent A.I.
